WP Plugin to integrate Agora.io communication tools to create channels
and videoconferences from Wordpress

## Description ##

This is the long description. No limit, and you can use Markdown (as
well as in the following sections).

For backwards compatibility, if this section is missing, the full length
of the short description will be used, and Markdown parsed.

    Note that the `readme.txt` of the stable tag is the one that is considered the defining one for the plugin, so

if the `/trunk/readme.txt` file says that the stable tag is `4.3`, then
it is `/tags/4.3/readme.txt` that'll be used for displaying information
about the plugin. In this situation, the only thing considered from the
trunk `readme.txt` is the stable tag pointer. Thus, if you develop in
trunk, you can update the trunk `readme.txt` to reflect changes in your
in-development version, without having that information incorrectly
disclosed about the current stable version that lacks those changes --
as long as the trunk's `readme.txt` points to the correct stable tag.

    If no stable tag is provided, it is assumed that trunk is stable, but you should specify "trunk" if that's where

you put the stable version, in order to eliminate any doubt.

## Screenshots ##

1.  This screen shot description corresponds to
    screenshot-1.(png|jpg|jpeg|gif). Note that the screenshot is taken
    from the /assets directory or the directory that contains the stable
    readme.txt (tags or trunk). Screenshots in the /assets directory
    take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win
    over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png` (or jpg, jpeg, gif).
2.  This is the second screen shot

Here's a link to
[WordPress](http://wordpress.org/ "Your favorite software") and one to
[Markdown's Syntax
Documentation](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax "Markdown is what the parser uses to process much of the readme file").
Titles are optional, naturally.

Markdown uses email style notation for blockquotes and I've been told:
\> Asterisks for *emphasis*. Double it up for **strong**.

`<?php code(); // goes in backticks ?>`
